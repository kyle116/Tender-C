### A brief summmary of out great App, Tender:

A user on out app will sign up or log in to gain access
to a randomized stream of images of tasty food from the user's
pre-selected area of choice.  A user will select to keep or pass on the
food given a check mark or an x.  The green check mark will save the details
of the restaurant.  From there a user can review all entries and delete
ones no longer found useful.

### Technologies Used:

The front end of this app was build int React.  
The back end was built using Node and Express with a Database from MongoDB.
The images are the result of using the Yelp Fusion API. Thank you Yelp Fusion.
Some additional CSS was brought to you by Bootstrap.
